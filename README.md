### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineering student at **ISET Djerba** 🇹🇳. I spend my time trying to connect the dots between complex back-end systems and what people actually see and use. 🧩

*   ✨ **My Philosophy:** For me, coding is about solving real problems, like making healthcare better or making online shopping a bit easier.
*   🏥 **Current Mission:** I'm working on **Post-Care Connect**, a platform that uses **AI** to keep an eye on patients after surgery to spot issues early and help them heal faster.
*   🤝 **Collaboration:** I’m always up for learning from teammates and sharing what I know. I’m flexible, excited by new challenges, and I focus on writing code that is clean and easy to maintain. 💎
