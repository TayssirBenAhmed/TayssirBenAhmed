Hey, I'm Tayssir Ben Ahmed.

I'm a junior full-stack dev specializing in web and mobile, and I'm really into AI and new tech.

I'm all about building smart, scalable software that actually helps people. I'm studying Software Engineering at ISET Djerba in Tunisia. I spend my time trying to connect the dots between back-end systems and what people actually see and use.

About Me

I'm super curious, especially when it comes to AI and new technologies. For me, coding is about solving real problems, like making healthcare better or making online shopping a bit easier.

Right now, I'm working on Post-Care Connect, which is a platform that uses AI to keep an eye on patients after they have surgery. The goal is to spot any issues early and help people get better faster using smart tech.

I like working with others. I'm always up for learning from teammates and sharing what I know. I'm flexible, always excited to tackle new stuff, and I try my best to write code that's easy to read and keep up-to-date.

Here’s what I know:

Languages
JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node.js, Dart
Frontend
Angular, Vue.js, React Native, HTML5, CSS3/SASS
Backend & APIs
Spring Boot, Symfony, Laravel, Node.js/Express, RESTful APIs, JWT Authentication
Mobile
Flutter, Android Studio, UI/UX Design
Databases
MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, PL/SQL
DevOps & Tools
Docker, Git/GitHub, Azure, UML, Agile/Scrum, Object-Oriented Programming

What I'm looking into
Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing
I’m looking into tech that helps doctors and patients talk to each other better using AI.
Cybersecurity in AI Systems
If we are building smart systems, we need to ensure they are safe, mainly when dealing with health info. I want to find ways to keep user info private.
Microservices Architecture
Being able to handle a lot of users is important. I'm trying to design systems that can handle growth and still work well.
